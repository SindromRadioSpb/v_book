# Handoff Status

## Current Task
- `task31`: product-grade NLP runtime management

## Current Phase
- Wave 3 PATCH-03 guided repair journey completed

## Completed
- Audit completed and recorded.
- Governance docs created.
- Product direction and rollout decisions recorded.
- Silent mock fallback removed from persisted processing.
- Configured vs effective runtime state added.
- Run-level runtime provenance added via `ProcessorRun.note`.
- NLP runtime visibility added to Health Check and Resources Manager.
- Resources Manager crash on hostile runtime probe was fixed with guarded fallback UI.
- Documents now exposes direct `Diagnose NLP` and `Open NLP Setup` actions.
- Stanza/Torch runtime probing is now isolated in a subprocess instead of the live UI process.
- Resources Manager now exposes packaging-aware repair steps and guarded NLP model-folder access.
- Wave 2 is now treated as the stable baseline for runtime-management behavior.
- Resources Manager now separates `External Runtime Dependency` from `Managed Hebrew Resource`.
- Documents and Health Check now use the same runtime/resource vocabulary.
- `ProcessorRun.note` now includes a stable nested `runtime` provenance envelope alongside legacy flat keys.
- Guided repair routing is now shared across Documents, Health Check, and Resources Manager.
- Live engine-init failures after a successful subprocess probe now collapse into the managed runtime-block path instead of surfacing as raw worker tracebacks.
- Documents can now recover from that managed runtime-block by offering a guided recovery dialog from the main-thread error flow.

## In Progress
- No active implementation in this patch series.

## Remaining Risks
- Resources Manager still does not provide a full guided install wizard; it provides truthful diagnostics and repair guidance only.
- Structured runtime provenance still lives inside `ProcessorRun.note`; it is machine-readable, but not yet promoted to dedicated schema fields.
- The guided repair journey is coherent, but it is still rendered across multiple surfaces rather than one dedicated wizard.
- The runtime recovery path is still diagnosis/setup/fallback orchestration only; it does not auto-repair the external `torch/stanza` environment.

## Next Step
- Proceed only if needed to Wave 4: decide whether stable structured provenance should graduate from nested note payloads into dedicated schema fields.
